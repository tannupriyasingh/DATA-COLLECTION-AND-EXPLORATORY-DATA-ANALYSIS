# DATA-COLLECTION-AND-EXPLORATORY-DATA-ANALYSIS

Explored and performed EDA on the real flu data collated by experts in Center for Disease Control (CDC).

Queried Twitter REST API to collect data and processed the data using twitteR library package of R.

Visualized geospatial information extracted from the tweets using geo-map libraries of R: ggplot2,
ggmap, maps, and map tools.

Compared CDC flu map with our home-brewed flu map of the USA derived from the twitter
data obtained.

Developed a Shiny app to publish the heat maps generated from EDA of raw twitter data. Link to the app: https://rakshitmtannupri.shinyapps.io/App-1/
